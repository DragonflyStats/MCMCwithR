Jaccard coefficient
The Jaccard coefficient is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets.

The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets.

The Jaccard distance, which measures dissimilarity between sample sets, is complementary to the Jaccard coefficient and is obtained by subtracting the Jaccard coefficient from 1.

CYK algorithm
In computer science, the Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK) algorithm (alternatively called CKY) is a parsing algorithm for context-free grammars. It employs bottom-up parsing and dynamic programming. The standard version of CYK operates only on context-free grammars given in Chomsky normal form (CNF).

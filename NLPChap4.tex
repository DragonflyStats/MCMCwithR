Lancaster rules Remove ist/s/e/ing/en/th/ity/ate/al/a/ed/ment/ation.
Replace -ies with -y.
Some motivations: reduce verbs to stem form, remove plural affix and
return stem in irregular cases (study), remove ordinal affix -th, remove
affixes that form nominalisations or adjectives: -ment, -al.
Porter rules Remove s/ing/ity/e/ate/ed/ment/ational.
Replace -y with -i.
Motivations: similar to Lancaster rules but applied more sparingly.
Errors Lancaster removes -th from south as if it were an ordinal and -e from are
though ar is not a stem here; not clear why -a removed from area. Lancaster and
Porter both treat some proper names as common nouns; for example, by
removing the last letter from Lyons and Stanhope (both) or by postulating an -i
stem for names ending in -y (Porter).
